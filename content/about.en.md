Just like you, we’ve grown tired of slow and unreliable internet packages. The big players don’t see an economic value in investing in our region, and standing alone we’re not capable of changing the status quo. So, listen to us and let us join forces.

## Our Story

One of our cofounders is in Stobrec, the other in Podstrana. For years in row there’s been no alternatives to the slow and unreliable internet in Podstrana. While Stobrec started receiving a rollout of higher speeds, they’re usually asymmetric and capped due to the ageing copper infrastructure. Today’s world needs at least 50/50 Mbits and such speeds are reserved only for professional and costly packages.

## Our Model

### Currently limited to Stobrec and Podstrana

Our model puts the users as equal partners, helping to develop our infrastructure. Unlike before, the infrastructure is yours to keep and do with as you please (nobody wants another scandal around the ownership of telephone cabling). We are focusing on fibre and 5G networks to establish a link to you - we’ll help you choose and install the equipment and can even offer financing - but the equipment is yours to keep and we’ll reimburse you for usage - be it by lowering the fee or by profit splitting as we do with equal partners.

### Available globally

We’ve specfiically targetted digital nomads with our hosting services. We can host development equipment for you, like embedded development kits. With access to our datacentres of at least 100/100 Mbit/s you won’t be able of telling them apart from locally connected boards. Carry only your laptop with you, and leave the rest to us.
